protocol_client
===============

 - sampler
 - sending non blocking
  - DMA: not yet. Use a sendComplete Interrupt
 - use CRC hardware (twice, header and payload)

Later

 - DMA to serial
 - test CRC hardware performance vs on cpu


Misc Notes
==========

Client Architecture

Reading: do everything in interrupt, nak/ack
