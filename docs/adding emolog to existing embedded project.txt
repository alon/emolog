Steps to add emolog to existing embedded project

- add emolog submodule
- copy emolog_work folder from another project (TODO should be in examples). Delete venv, delete other irrelevant stuff that exists there.
- add emolog_protocol and emolog_embedded as source folders in IDE
- include folders: add emolog_protocol and emolog_embedded
- copy emolog_comm.c from another project.(TODO should be in examples)
- modify #define huart_emolog    huart2 to correct uart
- in CubeMX: enable interrupt for this UART, but in NVIC settings make sure interrupt handler code is NOT generated (emolog_comm.c has an ISR)
- make sure UART ISR in emolog_comm.c has the correct name for the specific UART
- in main_loop.cpp:
	- include emolog_embedded.h
	- call emolog_init() call in main_init()
	- call emolog_run_step() in main_loop()
	- add handle_app_specific_message() callback
- modify emotool.bat with proper parameters: COM port, path to ELF, main loop frequency, flow control, etc
- modify process.bat (at least path to run logs)
- open a console in emolog_work folder:
	- run create_venv.bat (takes a while)
	-
